/*
 * Context Object: ctx
 *
 * Description:
 * - `ctx` is an instance of the `ReceiverY` class, managing the receiver's state and interactions during
 *   the YMODEM protocol. It inherits common functionality from the `PeerY` base class.
 * - Provides methods and variables for session control, synchronization, block validation, and communication.
 *
 * Key Variables in `ctx`:
 * - `goodBlk` (bool): Indicates if the last block received is valid.
 * - `goodBlk1st` (bool): True if the current block is the first valid copy of a new block.
 * - `syncLoss` (bool): True if a fatal synchronization loss has occurred.
 * - `closeProb` (int): Indicates file closure status:
 *      0 = no problem, -1 = file not yet closed, positive = error code.
 * - `errCnt` (int): Counts errors or retries (e.g., repeated blocks, timeouts, excessive NAKs).
 * - `NCGbyte` (uint8_t): The initial control byte sent to synchronize with the sender, typically `'C'`.
 * - `KbCan` (bool): True if a keyboard cancel command (`KB_C`) has been issued.
 * - `anotherFile` (bool): True if another file exists in the batch transfer.
 * - `transferringFileD` (int): Descriptor for the file currently being received (-1 if no file is open).
 * - `result` (std::string): Logs the result or status of the session (e.g., "Done", "Cancelled").
 *
 * Key Methods in `ctx`:
 * - **Session Management:**
 *   - `cans()`: Sends multiple CAN characters to cancel the session.
 *   - `clearCan()`: Clears consecutive CAN characters from the peer.
 * - **Block Validation:**
 *   - `getRestBlk()`: Reads and validates the remaining bytes of a block after SOH.
 *   - `writeChunk()`: Writes valid block data to disk.
 * - **Communication:**
 *   - `sendByte(uint8_t)`: Sends a single byte to the peer.
 * - **Timeout Management:**
 *   - `tm(int tmSeconds)`: Sets an absolute timeout.
 *   - `tmPush(int tmSeconds)`: Temporarily adjusts the timeout.
 *   - `tmPop()`: Restores the previous timeout.
 *   - `tmRed(int secsToReduce)`: Reduces the current timeout.
 * - **File Management:**
 *   - `checkForAnotherFile()`: Checks if another file exists for transfer (triggered at the end of a file).
 * - **Buffer Management:**
 *   - `purge()`: Clears the input buffer.

 * Receiver State Descriptions
 */

/*
 * Top-Level Receiver State: Receiver_TopLevel
 *
 * Description:
 * - Handles the initialization of the receiver's state machine and manages transitions
 *   to operational states (`NON_CAN` and `CAN`).
 *
 * Entry Actions:
 * - Sends an initial readiness byte (`ctx.NCGbyte`) to synchronize with the sender.

 * - Initiates a timeout (`ctx.tm(TM_SOH)`) to await the first control character.

 * Exit Actions:
 * - No explicit exit actions, as transitions directly delegate control to substates.
 *
 * Transitions:
 * 1. `SER` (SOH or CAN):
 *    - If `c == CAN`: Transition to `CAN` state.
 *    - If `c == SOH`: Transition to `NON_CAN`.
 * 2. `KB_C`:
 *    - Prioritizes keyboard cancellation, setting `ctx.KbCan = true`.
 *    - Cancels the session gracefully and records the cancellation result.
